# Project: Manoa Food Finder

## Project Goals
The main objective of the UH Food Finder project is to develop an application that helps students locate food options on University of Hawaii campus. The app will allow users to see real-time availability of different menu items, vendor hours and current menus across campus. We aim to solve the problem of not knowing what food is available or where to find it during short breaks on campus.
